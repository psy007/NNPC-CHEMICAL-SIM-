<p class=heading-3>Why Open Source ?</p>
<p class=heading-3-p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=body-text>Sim42 reflects the personality of its original creators &#8211; we like to be free and to do Science. This love for Science permeates our lives and expresses itself as a simple philosophy where honesty is important.</p>
<p class=body-text>We realize that excellence and honesty can go together if only and only if we are free. Free to learn, free to play, free to enhance, free to criticize, free to collaborate, free to express, and free to create. This desire to be free does not find proper expression in the current commercial process simulation scenario. Existing commercial process simulation software is expensive, sometimes ill documented, and hard to understand and fundamentally based on opaque and proprietary technologies. Since some of us are experts in thermodynamics, this large energy of activation decreases the business possibilities towards the commercialization of property packages. Some of us are specialists in modeling and simulation and the lack of widely available, inexpensive simulation tools is frustrating.</p>
<p class=body-text>Some of us were always intrigued by the development potential created by the Open Source movement. We use their tools and we are pleasantly surprised by their robustness and low price. Therefore we set out to create an Open Source Chemical Process Simulator &#8211; Sim42. We designed it to be a live, ever growing tool. Sim42 is not an end in itself as a common commercial process simulator, but it is really a framework for you to implement your ideas and enhance your business. We believe that the power and open implementation of Sim42, combined with the low cost, modular use of readily available commercial tools and state of the art design will provide you with an effective alternative to traditional chemical process simulation software.</p>
<p class=body-text>As you go further in your journey, we hope that elements of technology you have developed that are not critical to your business will find their way back into Sim42 and in turn will make Sim42 a better process simulation tool. In accordance to our freedom guidelines, you are not obliged to contribute, but we hope you will have the chance to make the whole much larger than the parts.</p>
<p class=body-text>Open Source software is not trivial software. You will see in Sim42 all the basic elements of a state of the art chemical process simulator, including an advanced distillation tower, chemical reaction parser and non-sequential solver.</p>
<p class=body-text>Open Source software is free as in liberty. You can use the source code for the creation of your own applications and distribute it according to the license described in this manual. You are free to create your own applications. If you need technical support, some of it can be obtained through the Sim42 bug tracker, or if you wish you can contact companies such as Virtual Materials Group for dedicated expert support and access to property package systems.</p>
<p class=body-text>Open Source is here to stay because our goal is to profit by creating a larger business  universe by owing less and providing more value to our users.</p>
